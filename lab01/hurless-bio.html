        Fiona Hurless is a Broadcast & Digital Journalism major interested in long-form news stories and television production. Hurless has been writing from a young age, winning an award from Indiana University in high school for outstanding photojournalism before moving on to write for The Newhouse. She recently picked up a position hosting a weekly radio show for Syracuse Universityâ€™s WERW and interned in communications for her second summer in a row in her home city of Chicago. Outside of school, Hurless enjoys being outside whether hiking, swimming, or just soaking up the sun. Her love for the outdoors actually inspired her photography hobby that she now uses in her work.
